I applied Algorand's Blockchain API to allow users to purchase intellectual property from organziatons through secure smart contracts. This process would avoid the complicated legal issues that come with IP contracts. I implemented the idea using NFTs as tokens that could be securely transacted from two different accounts. I also worked in an agile environment to create backend functionality and frontend experience for an interactive purchasing interface. I am currently working on the organization side of the website to allow them to sell their IP. My goal is to deploy the website by the end of the year.
